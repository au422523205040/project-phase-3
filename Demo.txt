Demo Instructions for Personalized E-Learning System

Objective

Demonstrate the functionality of the personalized e-learning recommendation system, showcasing data analysis, clustering, and real-time recommendations.

Preparation

1. Ensure the Flask server is running:

python app.py


2. Open a web browser or API testing tool (like Postman) to access the API.



Demo Steps

Step 1: Start the Application

Run the Flask backend by executing:

python app.py

Verify that the server is running at:

http://localhost:5000


Step 2: View Student Recommendations

Access the recommendations API:

http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations

The output will display student IDs along with personalized recommendations.


Step 3: Check Clustering

Open the clustering visualization (if implemented) to see how students are grouped based on engagement metrics.


Step 4: Analyze the Results

Explain the recommendation logic:

High engagement and performance: Encourage continued progress.

Moderate performance: Advise more consistent study routines.

Low engagement: Suggest increased participation and focused revision.



Expected Output

A JSON response showing each studentâ€™s ID and their corresponding learning recommendation.

Example:

[
  {"student_id": 1, "recommendation": "Engage more with assignments."},
  {"student_id": 2, "recommendation": "Great performance! Continue the same pace."}
]


Questions and Answers

What data is used for recommendations?

Student engagement metrics and performance scores.


How are recommendations personalized?

By clustering students based on data patterns using KMeans.



Closing the Demo

Stop the server by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.
