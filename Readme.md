Personalized E-Learning System

Project Title

Personalizing E-Learning Experiences Using Student Engagement and Performance Analytics

Abstract

This project aims to enhance the e-learning experience by leveraging data analytics to create personalized learning paths. By analyzing student engagement metrics and performance data, the system adapts content and provides customized recommendations to improve learning outcomes.

Problem Statement

E-learning platforms often lack personalized content, leading to disengagement and inconsistent performance among students. To address this, the project utilizes data analytics to develop personalized content delivery methods based on student engagement and performance patterns.

Objectives

Analyze student engagement metrics and academic performance data.

Develop models to identify individual learning patterns.

Design personalized content delivery strategies.

Implement adaptive learning pathways.
