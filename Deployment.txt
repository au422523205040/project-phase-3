Deployment Instructions for Personalized E-Learning System

Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x installed on your system.


2. Flask and required libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy flask scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly


3. Internet connection for installing packages.



Steps to Deploy

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/au422523205040/project-phase-3
cd project-phase-3


2. Start the Flask server:

python app.py

The server will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.



3. Access the Recommendations API: Open a web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations

The API will return personalized recommendations based on student data.




Testing the API

Use a tool like Postman or Curl to make a GET request:

curl http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations


Deployment on Cloud (Optional)

1. Deploy the Flask app on a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.


2. Use Docker for containerization:

Create a Dockerfile with the necessary dependencies.

Build and run the Docker container:

docker build -t elearning-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 elearning-app




Troubleshooting

If the server doesn't start, check if Flask is installed correctly.

Use the following command to check logs:

tail -f flask.log

For dependency issues, recreate the environment and reinstall packages.


Maintenance

Regularly update libraries using:

pip install --upgrade pandas numpy flask scikit-learn

Monitor server performance and update configurations as needed.
